What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you run git init, you are creating a hidden folder that will track changes to the repository called .git. Without this file, Git will not know what versions you have previously worked on - or where you are currently active.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a place to check that what you are going to commit all belongs together, before running the commit. It allows there to be other files in the working directory, that are not necessarily part of the project that you can then ensure aren't committed.
